        </a>, it&#39;s a place where users can come share their work and get inspiration from others. Epop was a group project I created during my time at General Assembly, in collaboration with David Harvey, Harry Murphy and Michael von Etzdorf. The brief was to create a full-stack application in one week. We created this full-stack application using MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Express, React and SCSS. This is the first full-stack app we have built, I hope you enjoy it :&#41; .ï½¡.:*â˜†</p>
